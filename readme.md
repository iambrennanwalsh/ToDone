## About ToDone!

[![ToDone! Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://todone.local)

ToDone! was a learning experience. This app represents my first steps in full stack web development. It's been refactored and embellished on quite a bit, but the end result is a simple app, which properly introduced me to the fundamentals of web application development.

The app itself is a productivity application. The core concept of Trello seemed like an easy enough project to emulate. So I worked on it for a bit. Set it aside for a few months. Came back to it. Set it aside. And finally I uploaded what I considered a "finished" product.

Some of the features:

- Fully functional authentication system (Login, Logout, Register, Forgot My Password, Reset Password, Confirm Your Email).
- User profile system with users able to update their account info, and even delete their account.
- Dashboard system where users can create an unlimited amount of boards.
- Each Board can hold any number of rearangeable lists.
- Each list can hold any number of rearangeable cards, which can move from list to list.

I first began work on this application a long time ago. I have since moved on to bigger projects, and don't think I will be updating this application anymore in the future. Theres work to be done on it, but I don't see the point in working on it. This app was an introduction for myself to web application development. It served it purpose. Now it serves as a proud member of my portfolio as well as a demo application for any students of Symfony 4 and Vue.js.

## Technology
